I saw a crazy chick a-running down the street
I said, a-whoo pretty baby, why the rigged beat?
She said, wow, what a square, don't you dig the scene?
Daddy Cool's playing his piano machine
Daddy who? Daddy Cool!
Daddy who? Daddy Cool!

Daddy Cool, Daddy Cool (cool daddy, cool)
Daddy Cool, Daddy Cool (cool daddy, cool)
Daddy Cool, Daddy Coooool
Daddy Cool, Daddy Cool (ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha)

She led me by the hand (cool daddy, cool)
Down to the railroad track (cool daddy, cool)
There in a tin roof honky tonk
Cool Daddy shook the shack (ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha)

The joint was dim and dark (cool daddy, cool)
Except for one spotlight (cool daddy, cool)
A-shining on to frantic hands...
That rock like dynamite (ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha)

(Rock Cool Daddy, honky tonkin' Daddy)
(Rock, rock, rock, rock)

The rhythm was so gone (cool daddy, cool)
I said, come on chick, dance (cool daddy, cool)
And as I held her in my arms...
I knew I found romance (ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha)

Then when they closed the club (cool daddy, cool)
I walked my baby home (cool daddy, cool)
But now I see her every night
'Cause she says I'm her own (ah-ha-ha, ah-ha-ha)
